# Welcome to the **FUN** Repository!

This repository is a small collection of projects that explore various topics in mathematics and physics that I love and care about. 

Most of the code is written using my favorite programming language Python (>> Fortran :). 

## Why This Repository?

Each project, though often small, has brought me joy. Maybe you will find some too ;) 

Physics and mathematics truly are awesome, and I believe thereâ€™s a spark of fun in every concept.
